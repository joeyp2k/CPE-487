# Lab 1
In Lab 1 we created two VHDL programs (leddec and hexcount) to count in hex.
Leddec when programmed on an FPGA allows the user to manually increment the counter on the seven segment displays using the switches available on the board.
Meanwhile, hexcount increments the counter automatically at a frequency of 2.98Hz.
