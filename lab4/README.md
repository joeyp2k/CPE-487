# Lab4: Hexcalc
In lab 4 we created a VHDL program that runs a functional hex based calculator.  After entering a number in hex using the provided keypad module, pressing BTNU enables the user to enter a new number in hex that will be summed with the previous number.  Pressing BTNL will perform the operation and display the result on the seven segment displays available.
The modified verison of this program enables the user to subtract numbers as well as disable any leading zeros on the seven segment displays.
